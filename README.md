===

*A mid-level graphics library for rust*

Introduction
------------
**rgx** is a Rust library built on top of [wgpu], a [WebGPU] implementation in
Rust. This library aims to be "mid-level" in that it exposes an API one level
above [wgpu], while still allowing the user to work with concepts such as
*pipelines* and *buffers*. The goal of **rgx** is to provide as simple an API
as possible without sacrificing performance.  See the `examples` directory to
get a feel.

At this stage, the focus is on *bitmap* graphics and *sprite rendering*. In the
future, support for 3D pipelines may be added.

The library is split into two modules, `kit`, and `core`. The latter provides
**rgx**'s core API with no assumption on what kind of graphics will be
rendered, while the former exposes some useful building blocks for various use-cases.
